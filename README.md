# StarBucks-Clone


I have successfully crafted a remarkable Starbucks clone using HTML and CSS. With meticulous attention to detail, I have recreated the iconic branding, layout, and aesthetics that define the Starbucks experience. Through HTML, I have built a responsive and user-friendly interface that closely resembles the original website. CSS has allowed me to seamlessly replicate the vibrant color scheme, typography, and visual elements, ensuring an immersive coffee shop ambiance. From the familiar logo to the menu layout, my Starbucks clone embodies the essence of the renowned coffee chain, providing users with a virtual taste of Starbucks from the comfort of their screens.
